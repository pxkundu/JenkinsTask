Here’s a simple explanation of what anyone can learn about Helm from this setup:

1. **What Helm Is**: Helm is like an app installer for Kubernetes. It makes deploying and managing apps easier by packaging everything into "charts."

2. **Installing Helm**: You’ll learn how to set up Helm on a Kubernetes master node using a simple script, so you can start using it.

3. **Using Charts**: You’ll see how to use a ready-made chart (like Nginx) from a repository (Bitnami) to quickly install an app, instead of writing lots of Kubernetes YAML files.

4. **Namespaces**: You’ll learn how to organize apps in Kubernetes by putting them in a separate space (namespace, like `my-app`), keeping things tidy.

5. **Deploying an App**: You’ll deploy Nginx with Helm, set options (like the number of replicas), and expose it with a NodePort to access it from outside.

6. **Managing Apps**: You’ll practice basic Helm commands:
   - **List**: See what’s installed (`helm list`).
   - **Status**: Check details of your app (`helm status`).
   - **Upgrade**: Change settings (e.g., add more replicas with `helm upgrade`).
   - **Rollback**: Undo changes if something goes wrong (`helm rollback`).
   - **Uninstall**: Remove the app (`helm uninstall`).

7. **Next Steps**: You’ll get a starting point to explore more, like making your own charts for custom apps.

In short, this setup teaches you the basics of Helm—how to install it, deploy a simple app, and manage it—while showing you why it’s useful for Kubernetes. It’s a hands-on way to go from zero to understanding Helm’s core features!
